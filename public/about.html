<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born and raised in the desert part of Texas, El Paso, I have always had a passion for technology and design.
  Growing up, I was fascinated by how things worked and how they were built. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in
  web development, where I could combine my love for creativity with my technical skills.</p>

<p>Growing up in El Paso, was great. I grew up in a middle class nieghborhood and made many friends who I still talk to to this day! (Thank you Facebook)
  After graduating high school, I moved to Denver, Colorado, where I was only coming for the summer, but end up loving it. I
  ended up getting my three older sisters to move here shortly there after. In September of 2000 I joing the U.S. Army where I worked as 
  a Helicopter Repair Technician.</p>

<p>After my service contract came to a close and I got out with an Honorable Discharge, I came back to Colorado where I ended up working in IT.
  From desktop to data center support, I have done it all. I have worked for some of the largest companies in the country, including Dish Network, Cricket Wireless, and SAports Authority. 
  I have also worked for some of the smallest companies in the country, including a small mom and pop shop that sold and repaired computers.
  I have always been passionate about technology and design, and I am excited to continue my journey
  in web development. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow,
  and I am excited to see where this journey takes me next.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, biking, and spending time with my family and friends. I also love to travel and explore new places,
  and I am always looking for new adventures. I believe that life is too short to not
  experience everything it has to offer, and I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself
  and grow as a person.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am excited to continue my journey in web development and
  I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for technology and design.</p>
